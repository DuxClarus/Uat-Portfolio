Objective 3: Create a quality object oriented software solution that meets specified requirements.

Final Project CSC360(Python): Is a game I created using cellular automata. I'm not going to describe the game but this project includes about 10 different objects that the game uses. 


CSC208Assignment5-6(C#): Is a console program that handles employees. This program includes a Employee object that inherits from a Person object and also has a has-a relationship with an address object. 

Death Flight(Python): Is a game I created during my 2nd semester at UAT. This project includes about 10 different objects. BUT these objects are all within the main.py. This is when I wasn't comfortable with having objects in other files. Also just a note I believe the game is set for infinte lives if you try and playing it.
